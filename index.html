            <p>Ninja Planet is a place full of ninjas but it has become overrun by scary monsters. There's nothing left for it but to seek to escape and build a new civilation on another planet. You are one of the heroic ninjas who is trying to escape Planet Ninja with their life intact. Right now you and your army are in the Diamond Mine but you're trapped by loads of lava spiders. You need to collect as many diamond swords as you so that you can all fight your way out, as the diamond mine is surrounded by two tribes who can only be killed by a diamond sword. The tribes are almost indestructable and are called the The Tentacle Tribe and the Undead Army. Both tribes look alike but they actually have very different personalities and are mortal enemies.</p>
            <p>Right now the Undead Army are in Zombie Town and you'll have to fight them later in the game if you want to successfully escape Planet Ninja, but more about that later. For now you need to get collecting those diamond swords before those lava spiders start completely overrunning this place...</p>
